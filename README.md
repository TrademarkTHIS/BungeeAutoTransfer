# AutoTransfer

Uses the priority system built into BungeeCord to determine which server is the default and which is the fallback. When your default server is down, this plugin will perform a repeated check to see when it comes back online. Once it comes online, the plugin moves all of the players from the fallback to the host. This plugin is used in my [Wake-on-LAN project](https://github.com/TrademarkTHIS/BungeeWoL), which I recommend you check out if you haven't yet.
