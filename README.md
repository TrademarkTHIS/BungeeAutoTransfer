# AutoTransfer

## Description

Uses the priority system built into BungeeCord. If your default server is down, this plugin will perform a repeated check to see if it's back online and move all of your players out of the fall back to it once it becomes online. Used in my [Wake-on-LAN project](https://github.com/TrademarkTHIS/BungeeWoL)
